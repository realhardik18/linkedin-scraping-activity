  "\n{\n  \"post_content\": \"6 words of the best advice for salespeople who lose deals in the final hour ⬇️\\n\\nDon't \\\"Await\\\" the Verdict. Influence It.\\n\\nA few years ago I noticed a strange pattern:\\n\\nWhenever I was waiting on a ‘verdict’ from a buyer, I lost.\\n\\n“We have a budget meeting on Tuesday where my boss is going to make a decision. I’ll let you know what we decide.”\\n\\nSome get excited to hear things like that.\\n\\nI dread it.\\n\\nDeals like that sound good.\\n\\nBut they almost always go south.\\n\\nThis isn't just true when closing deals.\\n\\nI noticed the same thing when raising funding.\\n\\nI noticed it again when recruiting.\\n\\nI usually lost when candidates said things like this:\\n\\n“Thanks Chris. I’m making my final decision on where to work next by Friday. Can I call you then and let you know what I decide?”\\n\\nTrust me when I say this:\\n\\nIf you’re passively awaiting a verdict, bad sign.\\n\\nYou’re going to lose whenever this is the dynamic:\\n\\n“Final decision meeting is on Monday. I’ll let you know then.”\\n\\nNow.\\n\\nYou might be thinking:\\n\\n“Damn Chris, you’re right! I lost 8 out of 10 deals where I was ‘awaiting a verdict!’”\\n\\nIf that’s you, your next thought is probably:\\n\\n“So what do I do so I don’t lose?”\\n\\nFollow this rule:\\n\\nDon’t await the verdict. Influence it.\\n\\nWhenever I'm in a pipeline review with my AE team, any time I hear a situation where they’re awaiting a verdict, I ask this:\\n\\n“How can we move from awaiting to influencing the verdict?”\\n\\nTwo examples:\\n\\nExample 1:\\n\\nBuyer: “I’ve got a final budget meeting with my CFO Friday. I should have an answer then.”\\n\\nInstead of waiting until Friday where your weekend will promptly be ruined, say this:\\n\\n“As you can imagine, I’ve helped a few dozen others sell this internally to their CFO. Mind if we find 30 min before the meeting to put a 1-page business case together? I can share some angles that worked in the past.”\\n\\nPerfect.\\n\\nNow you’re not awaiting your doom.\\n\\nYou’re taking the bull by the horns.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\n“I’m reviewing all of my notes between vendors and I’ll make my final decision Tuesday.”\\n\\nThis one’s harder.\\n\\nYou had a champion in your corner in the first example.\\n\\nBut this? You’re dealing with a coy buyer.\\n\\nSay this:\\n\\n“I can understand that, and I have to ask: If you learned nothing new between now and Tuesday, what would you decide and why?”\\n\\nA tad aggressive?\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\nBut now you’re getting something you can work with.\\n\\nInstead of saying “Ok… Talk Tuesday…!” you instead have a chance to influence their thinking.\\n\\nSee the difference?\\n\\nIf you’re awaiting a verdict, you are an ‘effect.'\\n\\nIf you’re influencing a verdict, you are a 'cause.'\\n\\nYou’re making things happen instead of letting things happen.\\n\\nBig difference.\\n\\nAs I reflect on the last decade selling SaaS, recruiting, and raising capital, I’ve found this to be true:\\n\\nYou will lose 8/10 deals where you’re awaiting a verdict.\\n…more\",\n  \"likes\": 351,\n  \"comments\": 45,\n  \"reposts_count\": 5,\n  \"tag\": \"Sales Training\"\n}\n",

They will EMBARRASS you.\\n\\nThey’ll roll their eyes as you lose them.\\n\\nOr they’ll tell you to\\\" get on with it\\\" while you lose control.\\n\\nInstead:\\n\\nQuestions that win over C-SUITE executives have 4 elements.\\n\\n1. They lead with a relevant observation.\\n\\n“So what are the biggest challenges in your org?”\\n\\nThere’s no insight here.\\n\\nIt doesn’t make them think.\\n\\nYou should have already asked this to their subordinates.

The question is perceptive and thoughtful.\\n\\nGo read the example again.\\n\\nThe observation doesn’t end with a generic:\\n\\n“So what do you think is going to be hard about this?”\\n\\nThat’s not bad.

The question is problem-focused.\\n\\nNot product-focused.\\n\\nNot YOU-focused.\\n\\nAsk a question that FEELS agnostic to your product.\\n\\nThe question should put the spotlight on your buyer and their world.\\n\\nNot on “how you can help.”\\n\\nThey're not ready for that conversation yet.\\n\\n4. The question makes them THINK or RESPOND emotionally.\\n\\nYou’re looking for two responses:\\n\\nA) A lightbulb moment.\\n\\nYou asked a question that made them think to themselves:\\n\\n“Damn, I haven’t thought of that yet but there’s something here.”\\n\\nB) Emotionally respond\\n\\nIf your question doesn’t make them think, it should at least trigger an enthusiastic response.\\n\\nOne where your buyer feels like you REALLY “get it.”\\n\\nYou can sense whether you’ve hit the mark.\\n\\nYour buyer’s voice changes.\\n\\nThey sit up.\\n\\nThey lean in.\\n\\nYou’re struck a chord.\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nGo watch the video to get a word for word example.\\n\\nPlus, a breakdown of the question.\\n\\nWhen you master asking thought-provoking questions?\\n\\nBigger deals.\\n\\nBigger commission checks.\\n\\nBigger W2s.\\n\\nYou know, the things that got you into sales in the first place.\\n\\nGo get it.\\n\\nOh.

  "\n{\n  \"post_content\": \"8 (painful) differences between the best and worst SaaS Sellers ⤵⤵\\n\\n1. Pricing.\\nThe best salespeople can quote you $350,000 with a straight face. Totally casual. Zero hangups. Calm, cool, collected.\\nThe worst salespeople tremble and shake when they talk big money. They’re uncomfortable talking about price and it shows.\\n\\n2. Discovery.\\nThe best salespeople uncover the ‘need behind the need.’ They don’t stop with surface level need. They go deep, but in a conversational way.\\nThe worst salespeople show their product at the slightest hint of a need they can solve. Discovery be damned.\\n\\n3. Prospecting.\\nThe best salespeople know that’s it’s too early to sell the benefits of their product. So they do something different. They agitate the problem. They articulate the buyer’s pain better than the buyer can.\\nThe worst salespeople focus their outreach on the product. It’s benefits. How it works. It’s features. The ROI.\\n\\n4. Discounts.\\nThe worst salespeople lob huge discounts “if you sign this month.” Even if the buyer is nowhere near a decision.\\nIt’s not that the best salespeople never use discounts. But they only give ‘qualified discounts.’ The ask why the buyer is asking for it. They qualify whether the buyer has the authority to act on it. Only then do they consider it.\\n\\n5. Next Steps.\\nThe worst salespeople “pencil in” a meaningless calendar invite as a next step. Or worse, they schedule nothing and follow up via email.\\nThe best salespeople know what the next step should be, who should be involved, and why. Plus, they see around corners. They are thinking about the next THREE steps. Not just the next one.\\n\\n6. Demos.\\nThe worst salespeople show you ever feature. The more they show, the more value they build, they think.\\nThe best salespeople “solve exactly.” They show you exactly what pieces of their product solve your problem. They leave out everything else. \\n\\n7. Negotiation.\\nThe worst salespeople don’t negotiate. They haggle. The only tool they have in their negotiation kit is to give something away and ask for something in return.\\nThe best salespeople treat negotiation as problem solving. They ask about the buyer’s underlying need behind the concession request. They find creative ways to address it.\\n\\n8. Skill Acquisition.\\nThe worst salespeople think sales is a born trait. You have it or you don’t.\\nThe best salespeople know that “sales” is just a collection of skills. Each one can be learned, practiced, reinforced, and mastered. So they build their skills accordingly.\\n\\nThese are 8 key differences.\\n\\nThe good news?\\nYou can move from “worst” to “best” with new skills.\\nYou’re not YEARS away from anything you want.\\nYou’re SKILLS away from anything you want.\\nNew skills are how you collapse a decade into a year.\\n\\nP.S.

  "\n{\n  \"post_content\": \"20 sales cheat codes I wish I knew when I started my first AE job:\\n\\n1. Buyers spend more to relieve pain than to achieve gain. Stop obsessing about benefits. Start obsessing about problems.\\n\\n2. The biggest opportunity your competition is probably not leveraging is deep multi-threading.\\n\\n3. The demo your product team teaches you never works. They mean well, but they are too interested in making customers aware of every feature. Only show the features that solve problems. Leave off the rest.\\n\\n4. One of the best sales hacks is responding fast. Responding fast to inbound leaders. Responding fast to emails. Buyers mirror your speed.\\n\\n5. Personalization will help you book more outbound meetings. But there are diminishing returns. Adding too much personalization creates a lot of work and doesn't add to conversion.\\n\\n6. Offering an 'end of month' discount only ever works if your buyer has control over pulling the trigger. If they have to get approval from others, go through legal, procurement, etc. it's not going to work.\\n\\n8. Spend more time getting new influencers up to speed on past conversations you've had with their colleagues. \\n\\n9. A great question will always have more influence power than a great statement.\\n\\n10. People don't buy because of ROI. ROI doesn't create demand. It justifies demand. Position your ROI accordingly.\\n\\n11. Your perfect sales technique will not close the deal if you're talking to the wrong person. I still remember the best discovery call I've ever run. I didn't close the deal. Wrong person.\\n\\n12. Social selling isn't better than cold email. Cold email isn't better than cold calling. These channels work together. Leverage them as 'land, sea, and air.' Stop thinking binary.\\n\\n13. If you can describe your buyer's problem better than they can describe it, their lightbulbs will turn on. It's a beautiful thing. Buyers favor the seller that can best articulate their problems.\\n\\n14. Get to know your market like the back of your hand. If you know your buyers so well that you can peer into their soul, you'll rarely lose.\\n\\n15. Buyers never reveal the real problem after the 1st or 2nd question. Uncovering the 'need behind the need' is the closest thing to a magic bullet in sales.\\n\\n16. Executives want to know you've done your homework. If you show up to a sales call with a C-SUITE exec and ask a generic question, you'll lose them forever.\\n\\n17. Never negotiate price until it's the last open issue. If agreeing on price doesn't close the deal, it's too early to negotiate.\\n\\n18. Every time you demo a feature, preface it with the problem it solves. You'll double your demo effectiveness with this change alone.\\n\\n19. Stop blaming buyers for falling short. If they said they were going to sign last month, and they didn't, that's your fault. Not theirs.\\n\\n20. The best product demos are more about the customer than they are about product.\\n\\nP.S.

  "\n{\n  \"post_content\": \"9 embarrassing sales mistakes I wish I knew when I started:\\n\\n1. Pitching benefits in cold emails. The best cold emails are surprising devoid of the product. Even its benefits. Instead they agitate pain. They look like a page out of your buyer's private journal. Pain now. Product later.\\n\\n2. Showing features that don't map to pain. If a feature doesn't align with a pain your customer shared, leave it out of the demo. Make every feature 'audition' for the demo. Bench the ones that don't map to pain. You're not building value by oversharing. You're destroying it.\\n\\n3. Spending too much time with the wrong buyer. The single best sales call I ever ran? I still didn't close the deal. Why? There's no sales technique on the planet that can save you if you're talking to a \\\"low propensity\\\" buyer. Who > What and How in sales.\\n\\n4. 'Letting up' on the gas when I had a big pipeline. We all have a tendency to slow down with prospecting when your pipeline is big. This is the cause of income rollercoasters. A big pipeline can turn small 'very' quickly with deals closing, falling out, or going south. If you haven't been prospecting? You're in for a lean season.\\n\\n5. Drinking too much. Sales is a performance job. Plain and simple. If you drink too many nights a week, you're nothing compared to your potential. It took all of my twenties to realize this. \\n\\n6. Filling a need as soon as I found one. Almost every AE does this. You jump on a call. You ask a few questions. The customer shares a need you can fill. And BAM!!!! \\\"We can help with that!\\\" If this is you, know that you only understand 10% of the problem. That is a disservice to them, and your W2. \\n\\n7. Generic discovery with executives. I read all the classic books. SPIN Selling. Solution Selling. All of it. I assumed it all applied when you landed the meeting with the C-SUITE. Not the case. When you arrive in a C-SUITE meeting, your questions should be piercingly specific. None of this \\\"So what are your biggest challenges?\\\" I once had a COO leave the room after I asked a handful of questions like that. Was he a jerk? Sure. Did I suck? You bet.\\n\\n8. Confusing influencers with champions. There's nothing you can do to create urgency more than creating a champion. One that's willing to run through walls to get a deal done. Most companies have a potential champion somewhere in the building. It's your job to find them, and activate them. \\n\\n9. Negotiating price in a vacuum. If you're negotiating, and your counterpart is not up to speed on the business problem, good luck. They aren't there to create mutual value. They are there to exact price discounts. Review the business value first. Negotiate second.\\n\\nWhat mistakes did you make early on?\\n\\nP.S. Make 2025 your best income and W2 year ever.

Quantifying customer pain.\\nNo measurement, no money. Quantifying pain does three things: a) justifies the spend b) creates urgency c) helps your customer appreciate the magnitude of the problem. Try asking: \\\"What metric is suffering as a result of these challenges?\\\"\\n\\n3. Creating champions.\\nA great champion runs through brick walls to get the deal done. They sell your product internally when you're not in the room. Indeed: Salespeople don't close deals. Champions do. A league of champions is like a magnetic force for closing deals.\\n\\n4. Business acumen.\\nThe best sellers in the world are actually businesspeople that happen to know how to sell. Don't just improve your SALES acumen. Improve your BUSINESS acumen. Senior execs will respect you 10x more than reps who only know the latest sales techniques.\\n\\n5. Executive conversations\\nYou can close five-figure deals without this skill. But if you want to close six, seven, and eight figure deals? You better have gravitas when it comes to 'facing off' with senior execs. They're direct. They use plain language. They're efficient.\\n\\n6. Negotiation.\\nNegotiation is a 'threshold' skill. That means it makes almost all of your other skills more valuable. Becoming a great negotiator will pay dividends the rest of your life. Dig in and master it.\\n\\n7. Writing.\\nClear writing indicates clear thinking. Sloppy writing indicates sloppy thinking. Your job as a seller is to persuade and communicate. Become a master of every medium that involves: - sales calls - written word - group presentations\\n\\nWhat skills would you add?\",\n  \"likes\": 510,\n  \"comments\": 46,\n  \"reposts_count\": 19,\n  \"tag\": \"Sales Strategy\"\n}\n",
  "\n{\n  \"post_content\": \"According to Gong, 53% of \\\"commit\\\" deals don't close by quarter-end. Here's a call I had with a tough prospect that shows exactly why (and what to do instead to close deals on time): \\\"We won't move forward without this,\\\" he started.\\n\\nHim: \\\"I want to see a full rollout plan, including professional services, for the first year before we're comfortable moving forward.\\\"\\n\\n**most reps would instantly agree to this, only to be disappointed that it doesn't close the deal**\\n\\nMe: \\\"Let's assume we did that and you were comfortable with the plan. What would still have to happen before you moved forward with us?\\\"\\n\\nHim: \\\"A customer reference. I'd want to talk to a happy customer of yours to see how the rollout went. This is a big deal for us so I want to eliminate risk wherever I can.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Ok. Assume we gave you a rollout plan you were happy with, plus 1-2 customer references. Then what happens next before you move forward?\\\"\\n\\nHim: \\\"We'd still have to get final sign-off from the CRO. She's aware of the proposal, but we need to get her comfortable with the details and business case.\\\"\\n\\nMe: \\\"Makes sense. Based on that, here's what I suggest:\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the spirit of partnership, we are happy to make those investments in you in the form of creating a rollout plan and arranging a customer reference.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As long as you meet us halfway and that investment is reciprocated.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It feels like we still have plenty of work to do with your CRO after those are done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So let me know if it feels fair to you that we flip the order in which we tackle these upside down:\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'd hate to jointly do all this work only for your CRO to shoot everything down at the end.\\n\\nSo let's get her on board first... then tackle the rollout plan and customer references.\\\"\\n\\nFair?\\\"\\n\\nHe agreed and we baked it into a mutual success plan.\\n\\nEventually, that deal closed. On time, and as planned.\\n\\nTAKEAWAYS:\\n\\n1. Had I agreed to his first ask without further qualification, I would have gotten it done, thinking the deal was in the bag, only to find out I'm not even halfway there.\\n\\n2. It's NOT your customer's job to create the right 'order of operations' in your mutual success plan. It's YOURS.\\n\\n3. When customers have big 'ASKS' in the sales cycle, don't agree to them until you know what still has to happen AFTER you've completed it.\\n\\nOtherwise, you're chasing your tail.\\n\\nTry asking this:\\n\\n\\\"Let's assume we do all that -- what would still have to happen before you and your company will be ready to move forward?\\\"\\n\\nGet ALL the asks on the table first.\\n\\nTHEN decide what you will (or won't) agree to.\\n\\nGive some.\\n\\nGet some.\\n\\nCreate a mutual plan.\\n\\nThose were MY three takeaways.
